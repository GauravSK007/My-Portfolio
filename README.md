# My-Portfolio
Welcome to the source code of my personal developer portfolio!  
A pixel-perfect playground where I blend clean code, retro aesthetics, and late-night caffeine into digital experiences.
##  About This Project

This portfolio is a creative representation of who I am â€” a Computer Science student, curious developer, and a night owl who loves building things that (hopefully) work.

It includes:

-  A retro-styled **pixel-themed landing page**
-  Interactive **terminal-style hero section**
-  Detailed **About Me**, **Projects**, and **Tech Stack**
-  A **Contact form** with Netlify form handling
-  A sneaky little **Easter egg** (go find it ğŸ˜‰)
